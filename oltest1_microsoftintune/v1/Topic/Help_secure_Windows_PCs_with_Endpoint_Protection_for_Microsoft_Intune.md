# Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] can help you to secure your managed computers in a number of ways, including Endpoint Protection which provides real-time protection against malware threats, keeps malware definitions up-to date, and automatically scans computers. [!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] also provides tools that help you to manage and monitor malware attacks

If you have not yet installed the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client on your computers, see [Install the Windows PC client with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Install_the_Windows_PC_client_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

Use the information in the following sections to help you configure, deploy and monitor [!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)].

## Using Endpoint Protection in Microsoft Intune

### Before you start
As an IT admin, one of your top priorities is to keep the computers that you manage free of malware and viruses. Before you deploy [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] to client computers in your organization, you should decide how to protect your computers by selecting one of the following options and configuring its associated policy settings:

|I want to:|Endpoint Protection policy settings|More information|
|--------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
|Use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] only if no third-party endpoint protection application is installed<br /><br />You can use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] on all computers where a third-party endpoint protection application is not installed.|Install Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Enable Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed = **No**|If a third-party endpoint protection application is detected, [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] will not be installed, or will be uninstalled if it has already been installed.|
|Use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)], even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed<br /><br />With this approach, you will be running [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] and the third party endpoint protection application (if it is installed) simultaneously. This is not a recommended configuration because of potential performance issues.|Install Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Enable Endpoint Protection = **Yes**<br /><br />Install Endpoint Protection even if a third-party endpoint protection application is installed = **Yes**|Use when:<br /><br />-   You want to switch to using [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)].<br />-   You deploy a new client that will use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)]<br />-   You upgrade any client that will use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)].|
|Use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] without [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)]<br /><br />In this case, you won’t be using [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] to protect your computers from malware and viruses. Instead, you will rely on a third-party endpoint protection application.|Install Endpoint Protection = **No**|If you are not using a third-party endpoint protection application, this configuration is not recommended, as it could expose your organization’s computers to malware or other attacks.<br /><br />[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] is not installed, and it is uninstalled if it was installed previously.|
If you want to switch from your current endpoint protection application to [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)], use the following steps which are explained in more detail later in this topic:

1.  Leave your current endpoint protection application running while you deploy the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client software to those computers.

2.  Confirm that [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)][!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] is installed and is helping to secure client computers.

3.  Remove the third-party endpoint protection software by:

    -   Using [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] software distribution to deploy a software removal tool that is provided by the manufacturer of the third-party endpoint protection application. For more information, see [Deploy and configure apps with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Deploy_and_configure_apps_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

    -   Removing the third-party endpoint protection application manually.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] will not uninstall third-party endpoint protection applications.

### <a name="BKMK_HowtoConf"></a>How to configure Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection
Use the following procedure to help you configure [!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] for [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] can manage [!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] for Windows 10 Technical Preview. Certain policy settings are only available for Windows 10.

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), click **Policy** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Configure and deploy a **Microsoft Intune Agent Settings** policy for the [!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] settings. You can use recommended settings or customize the settings. If you need more information about how to create and deploy policies, see the [Common Windows PC management tasks with the Microsoft Intune computer client](../Topic/Common_Windows_PC_management_tasks_with_the_Microsoft_Intune_computer_client.md) topic.

    The tables after this procedure show the values you can configure in the policy and also the recommended values that will be used if you don’t customize the policy. You can find these settings in the **Endpoint Protection** section.

You can view the deployed [!INCLUDE[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] policy on the **All Policies** page of the **Policy** workspace.
