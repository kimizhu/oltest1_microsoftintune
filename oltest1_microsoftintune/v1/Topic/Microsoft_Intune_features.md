# Microsoft Intune features
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] provides a cloud-based service that can help your business protect and manage devices. Because it is cloud-based, it can be administered from any Silverlight-enabled web browser. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] can manage:

-   **Mobile devices** (including phones and tablets running Android, iOS, Windows Phone and Windows RT operating systems). Computers running Windows 8.1 can be managed as mobile devices, or can be managed as computers using the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client software.

-   **Computers** running a professional edition of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.

For more information on mobile devices and computers that you can manage with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], see [Mobile device management capabilities in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Mobile_device_management_capabilities_in_Microsoft_Intune.md) and [Windows PC management capabilities in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Windows_PC_management_capabilities_in_Microsoft_Intune.md).

This evaluation guide covers the following:

-   [Intune capabilities](../Topic/Microsoft_Intune_features.md#WIT_Cap)

-   [Intune administration](../Topic/Microsoft_Intune_features.md#WIT_Adm)

-   [Intune free trial and pricing](../Topic/Microsoft_Intune_features.md#WIT_Fre)

## <a name="WIT_Cap"></a>Intune capabilities
**General capabilities:**

-   **Manage mobile devices and computers, no servers or intranet required.** You can manage mobile devices and computers, even if those devices are not joined to a domain or brought on-site. This makes [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] ideal for a company with a mobile or geographically-distributed workforce.

-   **Require encryption of mobile devices and computers.** Mobile devices that support encryption can be required to use it. You can also require computers that support Bitlocker drive encryption to use it. If a mobile device or computer with encryption is lost or stolen, the data on the device’s storage media is unreadable, helping to secure that data it from theft.

-   **Generate hardware and software inventories and reports.** You can gather information on the hardware and software used by your company, helping you to plan your hardware upgrade cycle or determine if unwanted software is installed on managed devices.

-   **Monitor mobile devices and computers.** You can create alerts to notify you when there is a problem with a mobile device or a computer, and also have alerts trigger e-mail notifications so that the right people are informed of the problem.

-   **Provide a “self-service” model for IT.** Users can use the company portal to enroll devices, to install site-licensed software, or to find contact information for IT administrators.

-   **Support multi-factor authentication.** [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] now supports multi-factor authentication. For details, see [Protect Windows devices with multi-factor authentication](../Topic/Protect_Windows_devices_with_multi-factor_authentication.md).

-   **Available in multiple languages.** Intune is now available in the following languages:

    -   Chinese (Simplified and Traditional)

    -   Czech

    -   Danish

    -   Dutch

    -   English

    -   Finnish

    -   French

    -   German

    -   Greek

    -   Hungarian

    -   Italian

    -   Japanese

For a list of the countries where the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] service is supported, see [International availability](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/international-availability).

**Mobile device management (MDM) capabilities:**

-   **Configure passwords.** Password management differs across mobile device platforms, but all supported platforms allow you to require a password, limit the number of failed sign-in attempts, limit the minutes of activity before the screen locks, set the time for password expiration, and prevent the use of previously-used passwords.

-   **Control system and cloud storage settings for mobile devices.** These differ across mobile device platforms, but highlights include the ability to block the iOS lock screen notifications view (to keep meeting details confidential), and the ability to collect diagnostic data from Windows Phone 8.1 and iOS devices.

-   **Manage e-mail access for mobile devices using Exchange ActiveSync.** You can control e-mail access settings such as whether devices can download attachments, or how much of an e-mail folder is synchronized with a mobile device.

-   **Application settings.** You can control browser settings, and also such application settings as whether app stores can be used on mobile devices.

-   **Device capabilities, cellular and voice.** You can allow or deny the use of a camera, control roaming settings, and enable or disable iOS voice assistant and voice dialing features.

-   **Reset passcodes, lock or wipe.** You can reset passcodes if users lose access to their device, lock missing or stolen devices, or even wipe data off of missing or stolen devices.

-   **Certificate, email, VPN and Wifi profiles.** You can deploy certificate profiles to mobile devices, and also deploy e-mail, VPN and Wifi profiles. See [Enable access to company resources with Microsoft Intune - deleted](../Topic/Enable_access_to_company_resources_with_Microsoft_Intune_-_deleted.md).

-   **Manage corporate-owned iOS devices.** You can set up devices for enrollment and then distribute them to specific users, or you can enroll devices so that they can be shared by multiple users. See [Enroll corporate-owned iOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Enroll_corporate-owned_iOS_devices_in_Microsoft_Intune.md).

-   **Mobile application management.** Managed mobile apps can be configured to restrict certain app operations, such as copy and paste, to help protect your organization’s data. You can also use the managed browser to control the sites that users are allowed to visit. See [Configure and deploy mobile application management policies in the Microsoft Intune console](../Topic/Configure_and_deploy_mobile_application_management_policies_in_the_Microsoft_Intune_console.md) and [Manage Internet access using managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Manage_Internet_access_using_managed_browser_policies_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

-   **Conditional access.** Use [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] conditional access policies to control access to on-premises Microsoft Exchange email from mobile devices, even when the device is not managed by Intune. See [Manage access to email and SharePoint with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Manage_access_to_email_and_SharePoint_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

For a complete list of MDM capabilities, see [Mobile device management capabilities in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Mobile_device_management_capabilities_in_Microsoft_Intune.md).

**Intune computer management capabilities:**

-   **Manage software updates.** You can keep computers up-to-date, and manage when updates are applied.

-   **Set Windows firewall policy.** This helps to ensure that no computer used by your company has an inactive or improperly-configured firewall.

-   **Anti-malware protection.**[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] includes [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] Endpoint Protection, and allows you to set policies to ensure that computers are kept up-to-date with the latest anti-malware definition updates.

-   **Remote assistance.**[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] allows users to contact IT support staff, who can then provide assistance using a remote desktop feature that is included with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].

-   **Software license** management.  Track how many software licenses are available, and how many available licenses are being used.

For a complete list of computer management capabilities, see [Windows PC management capabilities in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Windows_PC_management_capabilities_in_Microsoft_Intune.md).

## <a name="WIT_Adm"></a>Intune administration
