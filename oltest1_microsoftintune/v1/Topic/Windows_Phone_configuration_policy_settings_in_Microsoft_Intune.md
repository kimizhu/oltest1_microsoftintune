# Windows Phone configuration policy settings in Microsoft Intune
Use the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)]**Windows Phone general configuration policy** to configure the following settings for Windows Phone 8.1 devices:

-   **Mobile device security settings** – Choose from a list of predefined settings that let you control a range of features and functionality on the device.

-   **Compliant and noncompliant apps** - Specify a list of apps that are compliant, or not compliant in your company. Windows Phone devices can block, or allow installation of these apps.

## Create a Windows Phone general configuration policy

#### To provide basic settings for the configuration policy

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Click **Windows** &gt; **General Configuration (Windows Phone 8.1 and later)** and then click **Create Policy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot create a configuration policy using recommended settings. You must create a custom policy.

3.  In the **General** section of the **Create Policy** page, specify a name and a description for the new policy.

4.  Use the information in the following sections to help you supply settings for the policy.

5.  When you are finished, click **Save Policy**.

The new policy displays in the **Configuration Policies** node of the **Policy** workspace.

## Deploy the Configuration Policy

1.  Deploy the configuration policy to one or more groups of users or devices in your organization.

For more information about how to deploy policies, see [Use policies to manage computers and mobile devices with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Use_policies_to_manage_computers_and_mobile_devices_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

A status summary and alerts In the **Policy** workspace identify issues with the policy that require your attention. Additionally, a status summary appears in the **Dashboard** workspace.

## Reference information for compliant and noncompliant apps

### <a name="BKMK_URL"></a>How to specify URLs to app stores
To specify an app URL in the compliant and noncompliant apps list, use the following format:

From the [Windows Phone Apps+Games](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/overview) page, search for the app you want to use.

Open the app’s page, and copy the URL to the clipboard. You can now use this as the URL in either the compliant or noncompliant apps list.

**Example:** Search the store for the Skype app. The URL you use will be **http://www.windowsphone.com/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51**.
