# Update apps using Microsoft Intune
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] can help you manage app updates. Use the information in this topic to understand how you can update apps when a new version is required.

## How to update apps
When a new version of an app you have deployed is released, [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] lets you update and deploy the newer version of the app. You can only replace a deployment with a newer version of the same app (using the same identifier). You cannot use app updates to update a deployment with a different app package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you deploy an app with a deployment action of **Required install** and later change the deployment action to **Available install**, updates to the app are not automatically installed on devices that installed the app before the deployment change was made. To fix this issue, you can do the following:
> 
> -   Have the user of the device go to the company portal, select the installed app, and have them click **Install**.
> -   Change the deployment action to **Uninstall**, and after the app has been uninstalled, redeploy the app with a deployment action of **Available install**.

#### To update an app

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://account.manage.microsoft.com/admin/default.aspx), click **Apps** &gt; **Apps**.

2.  From the **Apps** list, select the app you want to update, and then click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Edit Software** wizard, supply any new details for the app package.

4.  When you are finished, click **Update**.

When devices next check for available apps, the app will be automatically updated to the latest version.
