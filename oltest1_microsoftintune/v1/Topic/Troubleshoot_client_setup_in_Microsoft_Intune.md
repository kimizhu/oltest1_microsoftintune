# Troubleshoot client setup in Microsoft Intune

## Troubleshooting client set up problems
Use the following sections to help you troubleshoot common client setup problems.

### What to do if client installation fails

-   If no client software deployment alerts for the computer are displayed in the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](../Token/wit_adminconsole_md.md)], check the computer’s Internet connectivity and proxy configuration and make sure that the computer can communicate with the service URL, [https://manage.microsoft.com](https://manage.microsoft.com). Then retry the client software installation.

-   You can have an email sent to selected recipients when a client software deployment failure alert occurs by configuring a notification rule in the **Admin** workspace. For more information, see [Get notified by Microsoft Intune alerts](../Topic/Get_notified_by_Microsoft_Intune_alerts.md).

-   [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] displays the critical alert **Client Software Deployment Failure** if the client software fails to deploy. This will display in the **System Overview** page and **Alerts** pages of the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](../Token/wit_adminconsole_md.md)]. Check for alerts by using the following procedure:

##### To check alerts for failed installations

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), click **Alerts** &gt; **Overview**.

2.  On the **Alerts overview** page, you can review the following information:

    -   The top three alerts, which can be sorted by date, category, or severity

    -   The total number of active alerts

3.  Click **All Alerts** to display the following information on the **Alerts** page. Critical alerts are displayed first:

    -   **Name** – The name of the alert type that generated the alert.

    -   **Source** – A link to the source of the alert.  If the display threshold of the alert type is set to **All**, then this link will display a single affected device.  If the display threshold of the alert type is set to a value, then this link will display a list of all the devices that are affected by this alert.

    -   **Last Updated** – This indicates the time when the alert was last modified. If an alert is closed, the time when the alert was closed is displayed.

    -   **Severity** – This indicates the severity of the alert

### Microsoft Intune policy-related errors in policyplatform.log
For non-MDM Windows devices, policy errors in the policyplatform.log file may be the result of non-default settings in the Windows User Account Control (UAC) on the device. Some non-default UAC settings can affect Microsoft Intune client installations and policy execution.

##### To resolve UAC issues

1.  Retire the computer, as described in [Retire data and devices from Microsoft Intune management](../Topic/Retire_data_and_devices_from_Microsoft_Intune_management.md).

2.  Wait 20 minutes for the client software to be removed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Do not attempt to remove the client from Programs and Features.

3.  On the start menu type **UAC** to open the User Account Control settings.

4.  Move  the notification slider to the default setting.

### <a name="BKMK_Whattodo"></a>What to do if the client will not uninstall from the Microsoft Intune administrator console

##### To remove the client software by using the Microsoft Intune command line tool

1.  Open a command prompt in administrator mode.

2.  Go to the folder *%programfiles%\Microsoft\OnlineManagement\Common*

3.  Run the following command - **ProvisioningUtil.exe /UninstallAgents /MicrosoftIntune**

### Client installation error codes
The following table describes error codes that are displayed in **Alerts** if client software installation fails. It includes suggestions for resolving the problem that is represented by each error code.
