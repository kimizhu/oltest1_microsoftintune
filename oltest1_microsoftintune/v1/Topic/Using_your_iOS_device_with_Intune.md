## <a name="BKMK_ios_signin_cp"></a>Install and sign in to the Intune Company Portal app
The Company Portal is an app that you install on your device to give you access to your company or school apps, email, and network.  Before you can get access, you must install the Company Portal app, and then  use the app to enroll your device in Microsoft Intune. For more information, see [What happens when I install the Company Portal app and enroll my device in Intune?](#BKMK_ios_what_happ_enroll).

    If you are signing into the Company Portal app for the first time, and your company or school is using Intune, you will be prompted to enroll your device in Intune. To enroll, follow the steps in [Enroll your device in Intune](#BKMK_ios_enroll_your_device).

## <a name="BKMK_ios_enroll_your_device"></a>Enroll your device in Intune

## <a name="BKMK_ios_what_happ_enroll"></a>What happens when I install the Company Portal app and enroll my device in Intune?
You start by installing the Company Portal app, and then use the app to enroll your device in Intune. Once your device is enrolled, you  can use the Company Portal app to:

-   Access the company’s network, and your email and work files

-   Get company apps from the Company Portal

-   Automatically configure your company email account

-   Reset your phone to factory settings if it is lost or stolen

When  you enroll your device in Intune, you are giving your IT administrator permission to manage your device to help protect the company information on the device.

**What IT cannot see**

-   Call history

-   Text messages

-   Personal email, contacts, and calendar

-   Web history

-   Location

-   Camera roll

-   Personal data

**What IT can see**

-   Owner

-   Device name

-   Serial number

-   Manufacturer

-   Model

-   Operating system

-   Company apps

-   Personal apps

When your device is enrolled, your IT administrator can:

-   Reset your device back to manufacturer’s default settings if the device is lost or stolen.

-   Remove all installed company-related data and business apps. Your personal data and settings aren’t removed.

-   Require you to have a password or PIN on the device.

-   Require you to accept terms and conditions.

-   Enable or disable the camera on your device.

-   Enable or disable web browsing on your device.

-   Enable or disable backup to iCloud.

-   Enable or disable document sync to iCloud.

-   Enable or disable Photo Stream to iCloud.

-   Enable or disable data roaming on your device. If data roaming is allowed, roaming charges may be incurred.

-   Enable or disable voice roaming on your device. If voice roaming is allowed, roaming charges may be incurred.

-   Enable or disable automatic file synchronization while in roaming mode on your device. If automatic file synchronization is allowed, roaming charges may be incurred.

For the steps on how to enroll your device, see [Enroll your device in Intune](#BKMK_ios_enroll_your_device).

## <a name="BKMK_ios_whatis_cp_website"></a>What is the Company Portal website and what can I do with it?
The [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) is your company’s web interface that you use to manage your work computers and devices, and your personal computers and devices that you choose to use at work. You can do most of the same tasks on this website that you can do by using the Company Portal app that you install on your device.

You can do the following tasks from the Company Portal website:

-   Browse for and download company apps

-   Rename your device

-   Remove your device from Intune

-   Reset your mobile device to its factory default settings

-   Find contact information for your IT administrator

## <a name="BKMK_ios_use_mgd_apps"></a>Use managed apps on your device
Managed apps are apps that your IT administrator can configure to help protect company data that you can access in that app. When you access company data in a managed app, you may notice that the app works a little differently from what you expect. For example, you might not be able to copy and paste protected company data, or you might not be able to save that data to certain locations.

Different managed apps can also work together on your device to allow you to do your daily tasks, while keeping corporate data protected. For example, if you open a company file in one managed app, and another managed app is required to view that file, the managed app that allows you to view the file opens automatically. If a required app is not available, certain actions, like opening a document or accessing a web link from within a managed document, might not be available.

When you access company data in a managed app, you see a message like the one below, which lets you know that the app you are opening is managed.

![](../Image/IW_Help_pics/managed_apps_message.png)

### How do I get managed apps?
You get managed apps in a couple of different ways:

-   When your device is enrolled in Microsoft Intune, you either install the app from your Company Portal app or Company Portal website, or your IT admin might install it on your device. To find out about enrollment, see [Enroll your device in Intune](#BKMK_ios_enroll_your_device).

-   You install an app from the App Store and then sign in with your corporate user account that is managed by Intune.

### What can my IT admin manage in an app?
Here are some examples of options that your IT admin can manage in an app and that can affect your interactions with company data on your device:

-   Access to specific websites

-   Transfers of data between apps

-   Saving files

-   Copy and paste operations

-   PIN access requirements

-   Your login, using company credentials

-   Ability to back up to the cloud

-   Ability to take screenshots

-   Data encryption requirements

Some common apps that your IT department might manage are:

-   Managed web browser

-   Managed image viewer

-   Managed PDF viewer

-   Managed AV player

-   Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint

Contact your IT admin for more information about the managed apps on your device.

## <a name="BKMK_ios_erase_lost_device"></a>Reset (erase) your lost or stolen device
If a phone that has been enrolled in Intune is lost or stolen, you can reset it to factory default settings by using the Company Portal app from a different device.

> [!WARNING]
> Resetting a device to factor defaults removes both your personal and work information from it!

1.  In the Company Portal app, under **My Devices**,  select the device you want to erase.

2.  Tap  **Reset** &gt; **Reset**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, contact IT to reset it for you.

## <a name="BKMK_ios_data_collect"></a>Turn off Microsoft usage data collection
In order to improve its products and services, Microsoft automatically collects anonymous data about the reliability and performance of the Company Portal app and how it is used. You can turn off the collection of that data by using the Usage Data setting in the Company Portal app. IT administrators have no control over the collection of the data, and they cannot change your selection for the setting.

## <a name="BKMK_ios_unenroll_device"></a>Unenroll your device from Intune
When you unenroll your device from Intune, your device will not longer be able to access company resources and will no longer be managed by Intune. More information about unenrolling follows the steps.

To unenroll your device from Intune:

1.  In the Company Portal app, under **My Devices**,  select the device you want to unenroll.

2.  Tap  **Remove** &gt; **Remove**.

### <a name="BKMK_ios_id_your_device"></a>You are asked to identify your device when you're trying to enroll
If you are trying to enroll your device in Intune, and you see a screen asking you to identify your device, it means that at least one of your devices has already been enrolled and assigned to your account using a method other than the Company Portal app. In order for the Company Portal app to work correctly, you must identify if the device you're using has already been enrolled in Intune.
1. If you see your device in the list, tap it. If you don't see it, tap **new device**.
2. Tap **continue.**
3. Enter the last four characters of your device's serial number to help Intune confirm that your device is enrolled. To find your serial number, see [How do I find the serial number on my device?](#BKMK_ios_find_serial_number).
