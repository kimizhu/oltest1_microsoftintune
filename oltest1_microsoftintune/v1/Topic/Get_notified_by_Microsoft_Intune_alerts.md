# Get notified by Microsoft Intune alerts
Alerts keep you in touch with what's happening in [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)].

For example, alerts can notify you about the following events:

-   A problem with the Exchange Connector which affects mobile device management

-   Malware has been found on a computer

-   A conflict between two [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] policies was detected

-   The latest updates and information about the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] service (notices).

## How alerts work
Alerts are generated based on **alert types**, a set of preconfigured rules built into [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]. For example, the alert type **Cloud storage has 10% or less free space** alerts you when you are running out of space to store your apps in the cloud. You can enable or disable, and configure properties for each alert type. For example, using the above alert type, you can configure:

-   **State:** Whether this alert type is enabled or disabled

-   **Severity:** How serious is this alert?

    |||
    |-|-|
    |Severity|Description|
    |![](../Image/Critical_Alert.jpg)|Indicates a serious issue that you should investigate as soon as possible, for example, if malware has been detected on a computer.|
    |![](../Image/Warning_Alert.jpg)|Indicates an issue that isn't currently serious, but might become serious if you don't attend to it, for example, security updates are waiting to be installed.|
    |![](../Image/Informational_Alert.jpg)|Indicates information that isn't critical to your operations, for example, a new version of the Exchange Connector is available.|

Other alert types might contain different items you can configure such as the percentage of devices that must be affected by an issue before an alert is generated.

**When the criteria in an alert type is met, an alert is generated and displayed in the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] admin console.**

Additionally, you can configure [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] to notify you by email when an alert is generated.

## Configuring alerts
In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Admin** &gt; **Alerts and Notifications**, then choose one of the following configuration tasks:

|Task|Description|

|**Recipients**|Click **Add** to add a new email address that will receive the email notifications you configure.<br /><br />You can also **Edit** or **Delete** existing recipients.<br /><br />To receive notifications, you must also add this email address as a recipient under **Notification Rules**.|
|**Notification Rules**|Configures rules that define who an email alert will be sent to. You can either:<br /><br />**Choose an existing rule** - Choose a rule, then click **Select Recipients**. You can then select all recipients who will receive an email when an alert that fulfills this rule is generated.<br /><br />**Create a new rule** - enter a name for the rule, select the alert categories and alert severity that apply to the rules, select the device groups that the rule applies to, and select the users who will receive an email when an alert is generated.<br /><br />You can also **Enable**, **Disable**, **Edit**, or **Delete** an existing rule.|
