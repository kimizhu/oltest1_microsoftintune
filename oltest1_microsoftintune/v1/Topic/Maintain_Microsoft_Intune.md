Partners are advisors who can provide sales, support, and technical expertise to help you set up and maintain your subscription. You can add, change, or remove a Microsoft partner from your subscription at any time.

2.  Read the partner's terms in the email message.

**Remove a delegated administrator**:

When you remove a delegated administrator, you remove the partner’s permissions to access and modify your service. You can remove the delegated partner at any time.

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune account portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=698854), under **Support**, click **Overview**.

2.  On the **Support overview** page, under **Delegated administrators**, click **Manage your delegated administrators**.

Therefore, plan to use the built-in options to wipe devices to remove sensitive information, and plan to uninstall applications before ending active management. The process to uninstall applications is app-specific.<br /><br />Be aware that settings previously enforced or set by remain in place on the device.
