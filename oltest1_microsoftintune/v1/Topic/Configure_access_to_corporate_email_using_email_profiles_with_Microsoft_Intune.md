# Configure access to corporate email using email profiles with Microsoft Intune
Email profiles in [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] help you create, deploy and monitor Exchange ActiveSync email settings on devices. This lets user’s access corporate email on their personal devices without any required setup on their part.

You can use email profiles to configure the following device types:

-   Devices that run Windows Phone 8 and later

-   Devices that run iOS 7.1 and later

-   Devices that run Samsung KNOX Standard (4.0 and later)

-   Devices that run Windows 10 desktop, Windows 10 Mobile, and later

In addition to configuring an email account on the device, you can also configure synchronization settings such as how much email to synchronize, and depending on the device type, the content types to synchronize.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Whenever possible, choose the most secure options that your email infrastructure and client operating systems can support. Email profiles provide a convenient method to centrally distribute and manage email settings that your devices already support. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] does not add email functionality.

## How email profiles are secured
Email profiles can be secured using one of two methods:

### Certificates
When you create the email profile, you choose a SCEP certificate profile that you have previously created in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]. This is known as the identity certificate and is used to authenticate against a trusted certificate profile (or a root certificate) you created to establish that the user’s device is allowed to connect. The trusted certificate is deployed to the computer that authenticates the email connection, typically, the Exchange server.

For more information about how to create and use certificate profiles in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], see [Enable access to company resources using certificate profiles with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Enable_access_to_company_resources_using_certificate_profiles_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

### Username and password
The user authenticates to the Exchange server by providing their username and password.

The password is not contained in the email profile, so the user will need to supply this when they connect to email.

### Create an email profile

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Configure one of the following policy types:

    -   **Email Profile for Samsung KNOX Standard (4.0 and later)**

    -   **Email Profile (iOS 7.1 and later)**

    -   **Email Profile (Windows Phone 8 and later)**

    -   **Email Profile (Windows 10 Desktop and Mobile and later)**

    You can only create and deploy a custom email profile policy. Recommended settings are not available.

    For more information about how to create and deploy policies, see the [Use policies to manage computers and mobile devices with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Use_policies_to_manage_computers_and_mobile_devices_with_Microsoft_Intune.md) topic.

4.  When you are finished, click **Save Policy**.

The new policy displays in the **Configuration Policies** node of the **Policy** workspace.

### Deploy an email profile

1.  Deploy the email profile to one or more groups of users or devices in your organization.

For more information about how to deploy policies, see [Use policies to manage computers and mobile devices with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Use_policies_to_manage_computers_and_mobile_devices_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

A status summary and alerts on the **Overview** page of the **Policy** workspace identify issues with the policy that require your attention. Additionally, a status summary appears in the **Dashboard** workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to remove an email profile from a device, edit the deployment and remove any groups of which the device is a member.

## Next Steps
After successful deployment, user’s devices will be provisioned with the correct settings to access corporate email.
