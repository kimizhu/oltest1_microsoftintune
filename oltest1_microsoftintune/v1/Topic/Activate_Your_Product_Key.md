# Activate Your Product Key
You can use a product key to redeem a subscription or add users to an existing subscription.

You can purchase product keys from a Microsoft partner or reseller.

## Redeem your product key
To redeem your product key, enter the 25-character code.

-   If you are activating an Enterprise Mobility Suite product key, go [here](http://www.microsoft.com/ems/open).

> [!NOTE]
