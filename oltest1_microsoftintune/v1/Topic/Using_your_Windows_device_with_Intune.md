Your device doesn’t meet the minimum operating system version required by your IT department. Before updating your mobile device, check the current operating system version by tapping **Settings** &gt; **about**, and then tap **Settings** &gt; **phone update** &gt; **check for updates** to update your device.

Before updating your computer, search for **operating system** and follow the prompts to identify your current operating system version. To update computers with operating systems earlier than Windows 10, search for **Windows updates**.

To check the version for Windows 10 and Windows 8.1, press the **Windows** hotkey + **R**, type **winver** in the dialog window, and press **Enter**.
