# Exchange ActiveSync policy settings in Microsoft Intune
Use the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] Exchange ActiveSync policy to configure settings that let you control a range of features and functionality on devices that are managed by Exchange ActiveSync.

## Create an Exchange ActiveSync policy

#### To provide basic settings for the policy

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Click **Common Mobile Device Settings** &gt; **Exchange ActiveSync** and then click **Create Policy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot create a configuration policy using recommended settings. You must create a custom policy.

3.  In the **General** section of the **Create Policy** page, specify a name and a description for the new policy.

4.  Use the information in the following sections to help you supply settings for the policy.

5.  When you are finished, click **Save Policy**.
