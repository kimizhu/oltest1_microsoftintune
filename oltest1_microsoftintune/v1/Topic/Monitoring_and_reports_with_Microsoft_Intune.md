# Monitoring and reports with Microsoft Intune
As an IT Administrator, you want to monitor the status of devices in your organization. [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] provides two ways that you can monitor these devices, as well as software license status and actions that affect devices (such as wiping a device).

-   **[Reports](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646977.aspx)** help you to monitor the status of devices managed by [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] (including software update status, software installed, and certificate compliance). 
    Â These reports also let you examine the hardware and software inventory collected by devices and computers.

-   **[Alerts](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646958.aspx)** help you to monitor the health of devices managed by [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] (including Endpoint Protection status and warnings, to alert you to malware; and warnings related to scarcity of disk space or network connectivity).

-   Devices and computers that are managed by [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] return detailed information about their properties and installed software.  [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] gives you tools and reports to examine and present this data. For details, see [Understand your devices with inventory in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Understand_your_devices_with_inventory_in_Microsoft_Intune.md).
