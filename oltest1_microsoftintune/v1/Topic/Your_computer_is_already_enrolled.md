# Your computer is already enrolled
You are seeing this page because you ran Setup for the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] client software. However, the software is already installed on your computer and Setup cannot continue.

This could be because:

-   The client software was installed earlier, and Setup ran again.

-   Setup was run on the computer after an IT admin retired your device from [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)]. After your device is retired, it might take several hours before the client software is removed from your computer.

-   Setup has detected a recently failed install or failed removal of the client software.

## <a name="bkmk_install"></a>What Setup installs on your computer
Setup installs the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client. After Setup finishes, the client software continues to run in the background where it configures your computer for use with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]. This process can take some time to complete, and includes:

-   Enrolling your computer with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]

-   Submitting inventory about the computer hardware and installed software

-   Configuring [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] policy, including installation of Endpoint Protection (if configured)

-   Installing [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] Center

After [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] Center installs you can use it to access the company portal where you can link your computer to your work account.

## <a name="bkmk_center"></a>Microsoft Intune Center
The [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] Center installs as an app on your computer after the computer successfully installs the client software and enrolls your computer with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]. You can use the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] center to:

-   **Get applications from the company portal** - Find and install apps that are deployed by your IT admin. When you first sign in to the company portal on a newly enrolled computer you get the option to link your work account with that computer.

-   **Check for software updates** – Find software updates that are deployed by your [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] administrator.

-   **Start an Endpoint Protection scan of your computer** – You can start a scan for malicious software on your computer.

-   **Ask for remote assistance** – This option is available only when remote assistance is supported by your computers operating system.

## <a name="bkmk_validate"></a>Validate that the client software is installed or has been removed
**Validate the client is installed:**
The [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client installation is complete when the following apps are available on the computer:

-   **[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] Center**

-   **[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] Endpoint Protection** (if Endpoint Protection is enabled by your IT admin)

If you are comfortable with using Task Manager, you can search for the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client service, which should be running:

-   **OmcSvc**

**Validate the client has been removed:**
After the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client uninstalls from a computer, the apps that were installed when the client was installed are removed, including the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] Center.

The [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client service **OmcSvc** is removed.

## <a name="bkmk_remove"></a>How to remove the client software from the computer
By default, several hours after your IT admin retires your computer from the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] admin console, the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client software will uninstall.

To manually uninstall the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] client software from a computer, you can use the following steps to force the uninstall:

1.  On the computer, open a command prompt in administrator mode.

2.  Go to the folder **%programfiles%\Microsoft\OnlineManagement\Common**

3.  Run the following command: **ProvisioningUtil.exe /UninstallAgents /MicrosoftIntune**

This will schedule the removal of the client software.
