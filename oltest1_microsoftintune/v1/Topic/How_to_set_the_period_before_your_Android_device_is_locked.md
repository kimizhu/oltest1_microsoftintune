# How to set the period before your Android device is locked
To reconnect to your work, youâ€™ll need to set the password timeout on your device by following these instructions:

1.  In **Settings** on your device, click **Security** &gt; **Automatically Lock** (this appears as **Lock phone after** on some devices).

    If **Automatically Lock** (**Lock phone after** on some devices) is not displayed, ensure that you have set a valid password under **Settings** &gt; **Screen Lock** &gt; **Password**.

2.  Specify the password timeout value.

3.  Ensure that your device is enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] by following the instructions in [Enroll your device to use it at work](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=519071).
