# Android configuration policy settings in Microsoft Intune
Use the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)]**Android general configuration policy** to configure settings for:

-   **Mobile device security settings** – Choose from a list of predefined settings that let you control a range of features and functionality on the device.

-   **Kiosk mode** (for Samsung KNOX devices only) - Lock a device to only allow certain features to work. For example, you can allow a device to only run one managed app that you specify, or you can disable the volume buttons on a device. These settings might be used for a demonstration model of a device, or a device that is dedicated to performing only one function, such as a point of sale device.

-   **Compliant and noncompliant apps** - Specify a list of apps that are compliant, or not compliant in your company. On Android and iOS devices, the **Noncompliant Apps Report** can be used to view the compliance of apps you specified in the list against the apps that users have installed (but cannot actually block the installation of the app).

> [!TIP]
> You can configure terms and conditions for users to ensure that they acknowledge that apps on their device, including personal apps will be evaluated, and noncompliant apps will either be blocked, or reported as noncompliant. Users must accept these terms and conditions before they can enroll their device and use the company portal to get apps. For more information about using terms and conditions, see [Working with terms and conditions policies in Microsoft Intune](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ce59fb93-01fd-4822-a57d-45ca7d89843d).

## Create an Android configuration policy

#### To provide basic settings for the configuration policy

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Click **Android** &gt; **General Configuration** and then click **Create Policy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot create a configuration policy using recommended settings. You must create a custom policy.

3.  In the **General** section of the **Create Policy** page, specify a name and a description for the new policy.

4.  Use the information in the following sections to help you supply settings for the policy.

5.  When you are finished, click **Save Policy**.

The new policy displays in the **Configuration Policies** node of the **Policy** workspace.

## <a name="BKMK_Settings"></a>Mobile device security policy settings for Android devices
If the setting you are looking for does not appear in this list, you might be able to create it using an Android custom policy that lets you use OMA-URI settings to control the device.

## Deploy the Configuration Policy

1.  Deploy the configuration policy to one or more groups of users or devices in your organization.

For more information about how to deploy policies, see [Use policies to manage computers and mobile devices with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Use_policies_to_manage_computers_and_mobile_devices_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

A status summary and alerts In the **Policy** workspace identify issues with the policy that require your attention. Additionally, a status summary appears in the **Dashboard** workspace.

## Reference information for compliant and noncompliant apps

### Monitor compliant and noncompliant apps
Use the **Noncompliant Apps Report** to view the compliance of allowed and blocked apps.

##### To run the Noncompliant Apps Report

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Reports** &gt; **Noncompliant Apps Report**.

2.  Select the device groups that you would like to check, whether you want to check for compliant apps, noncompliant apps, or both, then click **View Report**.

### <a name="BKMK_URL"></a>How to specify URLs to app stores
To specify an app URL in the compliant and noncompliant apps list, or in the **Select a managed app that will be allowed to run when the device is in kiosk mode** option (iOS only), use the following format:

In the [Apps section of Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps), search for the app you want to use.

Open the installation page for the app, and copy the URL to the clipboard. You can now use this as the URL in either the compliant or noncompliant apps list.

**Example:** Search Google Play for Microsoft Office Mobile. The URL you use will be **https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officehub**.
