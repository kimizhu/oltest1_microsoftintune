# Help protect your data with remote wipe, remote lock, or passcode reset using Microsoft Intune
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] provides selective wipe, full wipe, remote lock, and passcode reset capabilities. Because mobile devices can store sensitive corporate data and provide access to many corporate resources, you can issue a remote device wipe command from the [!INCLUDE[wit_adminconsole](../Token/wit_adminconsole_md.md)] to wipe a lost or stolen device. Also, users can issue a remote device wipe command from the [!INCLUDE[wit_iwportal_1](../Token/wit_iwportal_1_md.md)] on privately owned devices enrolled in Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is only about wiping devices managed by Intune. You can also use [the Azure preview portal](https://portal.azure.com) to [wipe company data from apps](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt627826.aspx).

## <a name="bkmk_wipe"></a>Use Retire/Wipe to help secure a lost device or to retire a device from active use
**Full wipe** restores a device to its factory default settings, removing all company and user data and settings.     The device is removed from Intune. **Be careful about selecting full wipe; your data cannot be recovered**.

**Selective wipe** removes company data from a device.   The device is removed from Intune. The following tables describe by platform what data is removed and the effect on data that remains on the device after a selective wipe.

**iOS**

#### To remotely wipe a device from the Intune administrator console

1.  Select devices to be wiped. You can find them either by user or by device.

    -   **By user:**

        1.  In the [Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), click **Groups** &gt; **All Users**.

        2.  Click the name of the user whose mobile device you want to wipe. Click **View Properties**.

        3.  On the user's **Properties**  page, click **Devices**, and then click the name of the mobile device you want to wipe. Use Ctrl+click to multi-select devices.

    -   **By device:**

        1.  In the [Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), click **Groups** &gt; **All Mobile Devices**.

        2.  Click **Devices**, and then click the name of the mobile device you want to wipe. Use Ctrl+click to multi-select devices.

2.  Click **Retire/Wipe**.

3.  A message appears, prompting you to confirm whether you want to retire the device.

    -   To perform a **Selective wipe** which only removes company apps and data, click **Yes**.

    -   To perform a **Full wipe** that erases all apps and data and returns the device to factory default settings, select **Wipe the device before retiring**. This action applies to all platforms except Windows 8.1. **You cannot recover data removed by a full wipe**.

It takes less than 15 minutes for a wipe to propagate across all device types.

### Wiping Encryption File System (EFS)-enabled content
Selective wipe of EFS-encrypted content is supported by Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1. The following apply to a selective wipe of EFS-enabled content:

-   Only apps and data that are protected by EFS using the same Internet domain as the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] account are selectively wiped. For more information, see [Windows Selective Wipe for Device Data Management](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn486874.aspx).

-   If there are any changes are made to the domain associated with EFS, the changes can take up to 48 hours before apps and data using the new domain can be selectively wiped.

-   Each domain that is registered with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] will be wiped.

The data and apps that are currently supported by EFS selective wipe are:

-   Mail app for Windows

-   Work Folders

-   Files and folders encrypted by EFS. For more information, see [Best practices for the Encrypting File System](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/223316).

-   If your organization maintains its identity in Active Directory, it must use the Directory Sync (DirSync) tool to sync information into AAD for EFS selective wipe to work correctly.  For more information on DirSync, see [Directory Sync Scenario](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn441212.aspx) in the Azure Active Directory documentation.

### Monitor retire, wipe, and delete actions
To get a report of devices that have been retired, wiped, or deleted, and who performed the action:

1.  In the [Intune administrator  console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), click **Reports** &gt; **Device History Reports**.

2.  Provide a start and end date for the report, then click **View Report**.

### <a name="BKMK_passcode"></a>Reset the passcode on a device
If a user forgets their passcode, you can help them by removing the passcode from a device or by forcing a new temporary passcode on a device. The table below lists how passcode reset works on different mobile platforms.

|Platform|Passcode reset|
|------------|------------------|
|iOS|Supported for clearing the passcode from a device. Does not create a new temporary passcode.|
|Android|Supported and a temporary passcode is created.|
|Windows 10|Not supported at this time.|

2.  Click **All Direct Managed Devices** for devices enrolled in Intune or **All Exchange ActiveSync Managed Devices**.

    > [!TIP]
