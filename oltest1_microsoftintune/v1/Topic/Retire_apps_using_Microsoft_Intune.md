# Retire apps using Microsoft Intune
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] can help you retire apps. Use the information in this topic to understand how you can uninstall an ap when it is no longer required.

## How to retire apps
When you deploy and manage apps with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], the process to uninstall the app is the same for both mobile devices and computers. The app must support being uninstalled for this procedure to succeed.

#### To uninstall an app

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Apps** &gt; **Apps**.

2.  Select the app you want to uninstall (which you have previously deployed), and then click **Manage Deployment**.

3.  On the **Deployment Action** page, select **Uninstall** from the **Approval** column.

When the device or computer next checks for apps, the app will be uninstalled.
