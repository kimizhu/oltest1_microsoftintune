One of the primary reasons many companies use [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] is to deploy apps that your users need to get their work done. Before you deploy apps, you'll need to  [get your devices managed](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646962.aspx) .

For example, if your company uses Microsoft Word, there are versions available for Windows, iOS, Android and more. The challenge you, as an IT admin face is to manage the multitude of apps available, on many different device and computer platforms with the aim of allowing users to do their work while still ensuring the security of your company data.

In addition, [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] gives you a range of options that help you  manage app security and features including mobile application management policies that let you manage apps on devices that are not enrolled in  [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], or are managed by another solution.

## Understand the app lifecycle
Just like with the management of your devices, apps have a lifecycle that takes you from preparation, to deployment, monitoring, updating, and retiring. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] can help you at all stages of this lifecycle:

![](../Image/App_Lifecycle.png)

### Plan
In the [Plan for app deployment in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Plan_for_app_deployment_in_Microsoft_Intune.md) topic, you'll learn about some of the prerequisites and concepts you'll need before you start working with apps, find your way around the **Apps** workspace, and also learn about the different app types you can deploy.

[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] also gives you tools to [examine what apps are already in use](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj733634.aspx) in your organization and where they are installed.

[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] supports [installing a range of different apps](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn646955.aspx) including apps from the app store, web applications, and apps that were written in-house.

### Deploy
Once you understand the basics, you can start deploying apps. In these sections, you'll find all you need to know to prepare your apps for deployment, and then deploy them to [mobile devices](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646972.aspx) and [computers](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646961.aspx).

### Configure
[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] gives you tools that help you manage, configure, and protect company data in your apps.

-   Mobile app configuration policies to supply configuration settings to an app when it runs. For example, you can specify language, security, or network settings for the app.

-   Mobile app management policies help protect company app data by restricting functionality that transfers data between apps. For example, you can restrict cut, copy and paste operations within a managed app.

-   Managed browser policies configure an allow list or a block list that restricts the web sites that users of the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] managed browser can visit.

See [Configure apps with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Configure_apps_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

### Update
Modern apps are often updated regularly. It can be a difficult job to try and ensure that all of your users are running the latest version of an app. Fortunately, [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] provides a simple capability that lets you update a previously deployed app with a newer version of the same app.

See [Update apps using Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Update_apps_using_Microsoft_Intune.md).

## Retire
After a time, it is likely that apps you deployed to devices will no longer be required and you'll want to uninstall them. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] makes this process simple for apps that you manage.

See [Retire apps using Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Retire_apps_using_Microsoft_Intune.md).
