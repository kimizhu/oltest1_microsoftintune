# Manage SharePoint Online access with Microsoft Intune
Use the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)]**SharePoint Online** conditional access policy to manage access to OneDrive for Business files located on SharePoint online, based on conditions you specify.

When a targeted user attempts to connect to a file using a supported app such as OneDrive on their device, the following evaluation occurs:

![](../Image/ConditionalAccess8-6.png)

To connect to the required files, the device running OneDrive must:

-   Be enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] or a domain joined PC.

-   Register the device in Azure Active Directory (this happens automatically when the device is enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].

    For domain joined PC, you must set it up to [automatically register](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn935033.aspx) with Azure Active Directory.

-   Be compliant with any deployed [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] compliance policies

The device state is stored in Azure Active Directory which grants or blocks access to the files, based on the conditions you specify.

If a condition is not met, the user is presented with one of the following messages when they log in:

-   If the device is not enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], or is not registered in Azure Active Directory, a message is displayed with instructions about how to install the company portal app and enroll.

-   If the device is not compliant, a message is displayed that directs the user to the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] web portal where they can find information about the problem, and how to remediate it.

-   For a PC:

    -   If the policy is set to require domain join, and the PC is not domain joined, a message is displayed to contact the IT admin.

    -   If the policy is set to require domain join or compliant, then the PC does not meet either requirement, a message is displayed with instructions about how to install the company portal app and enroll.

You can manage access to SharePoint Online from the following apps:

-   Microsoft Office Mobile (Android)

-   Microsoft OneDrive (Android and iOS)

-   Microsoft Word (Android and iOS)

-   Microsoft Excel (Android and iOS)

-   Microsoft PowerPoint (Android and iOS)

-   Microsoft OneNote (Android and iOS)

## Steps to configure conditional access for SharePoint Online

### Step 1: Configure Active Directory security groups
Before you start, configure Azure Active Directory security groups for the conditional access policy. You can configure these groups in the **Office 365 admin center**, or the **Intune account portal**. These groups contain the users that will be targeted, or exempt from the policy. When a user is targeted by a policy, each device they use must be compliant in order to access resources.

You can specify two group types in a SharePoint Online policy:

-   **Targeted groups** – Contains groups of users to which the policy will apply

-   **Exempted groups** – Contains groups of users that are exempt from the policy (optional)

If a user is in both groups, they will be exempt from the policy.

### Step 2: Configure and deploy a compliance policy
Ensure that you create and deploy a compliance policy to all devices that the SharePoint Online policy will be targeted to.

> [!NOTE]
> While compliance policies are deployed to [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] groups, conditional access policies are targeted to Azure Active Directory security groups.

For details about how to configure the compliance policy, see [Manage device compliance policies for Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Manage_device_compliance_policies_for_Microsoft_Intune.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not deployed a compliance policy and then enable the SharePoint Online policy, all targeted devices will be allowed access.

When you are ready, continue to **Step 3**.

### <a name="BKMK_OneDrive"></a>Step 3: Configure the SharePoint Online policy
Next, configure the policy to require that only managed and compliant devices can access SharePoint Online. This policy will be will be stored in Azure Active Directory.

#### <a name="bkmk_spopolicy"></a>

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Conditional Access** &gt; **SharePoint Online Policy**.

2.  Select **Enable conditional access policy for SharePoint Online.**.

3.  Under **Device platforms**, you can choose to apply conditional access policy to:

    -   **All platforms**

        This will require that any device used to access **SharePoint Online**,  to be enrolled in Intune and compliant with the policies.  Any client application using **modern authentication** is subject to the conditional access policy, and if the platform is currently not supported by Intune, access to **SharePoint Online** is blocked.

    -   **Specific platforms**

        If you choose the **Specific platforms** option, you will see a list of platforms that you can individually select.   Conditional access policy will apply to any client app that is using modern authentication, but only on the platforms you select.

    > [!TIP]
    > **Modern authentication** brings Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)-based sign in to Office clients.
    > 
    > -   The ADAL based authentication enables Office clients to engage in browser-based authentication (also known as passive authentication).  To authenticate, the user is directed to a sign-in web page.
    > -   This new sign-in method enables new scenarios such as, conditional access, based on **device compliance** and whether **multi-factor authentication** was performed.
    > 
    > This [article](https://blogs.office.com/2014/11/12/office-2013-updated-authentication-enabling-multi-factor-authentication-saml-identity-providers/) has more detailed information on how modern authentication works.

    For windows PCs, the PC must either be domain joined, or enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] and compliant. You can set the following requirements:

    -   **Devices must be domain joined or compliant.** This means that the PCs must either be domain joined or compliant with the policies set in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]. If the PC does not meet either of these requirements, the user is prompted to enroll the device with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].

    -   **Devices must be domain joined.** This means that the PCs must be domain joined to access Exchange Online. If the PC is not domain joined access to email is blocked and the user is prompted to contact the IT admin.

    -   **Devices must be compliant.** This means that the PCs must be enrolled in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] and compliant. If the PC is not enrolled, a message with instructions on how to enroll is displayed.

4.  Under **Targeted Groups**, click **Modify** to select the Azure Active Directory security groups to which the policy will apply. You can choose to target this to all users or just a select groups of users.

5.  Under **Exempted Groups**, optionally, click **Modify** to select the Azure Active Directory security groups that are exempt from this policy.

6.  When you are done, click **Save**.

You do not have to deploy the conditional access policy, it takes effect immediately.

### Step 4: Monitor the compliance and conditional access policies
In the **Groups** workspace, you can view the conditional access status of your devices.

Select any mobile device group and then, on the **Devices** tab, select one of the following **Filters**:

-   **Devices that are not registered with AAD** – These devices are blocked from SharePoint Online.

-   **Devices that are not compliant** – These devices are blocked from SharePoint Online.

-   **Devices that are registered with AAD and compliant** – These devices can access SharePoint Online.
