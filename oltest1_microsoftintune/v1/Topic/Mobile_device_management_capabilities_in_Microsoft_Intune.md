# Mobile device management capabilities in Microsoft Intune
Intune supports mobile device management of iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices. It also supports management of Windows RT, Window computers, and Mac OS X computers as mobile devices. Users use a *company portal* to install apps, enroll and remove devices, and helps them contact their IT department or helpdesk. To enroll mobile devices you must set [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] as your *mobile device authority* and then configure the infrastructure to support the platforms you want to managed. This requires establishing a trust relationship with the device.

## <a name="BKMK_MobileDeviceReqs"></a>Supported mobile devices
The requirements to manage a mobile device and the level of management you have depend on whether you manage the device directly or use Exchange ActiveSync:

-   **Direct management**: Different types of mobile devices have different requirements for direct management. For example, to manage iOS devices you need an Apple Push Notification service certificate, and to manage apps for a [!INCLUDE[winblue_winrt_2](../Token/winblue_winrt_2_md.md)] device, you need sideloading keys and a code-signing certificate. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] can manage the following devices with mobile device management:

    -   Apple iOS 7.1 and later

        > [!NOTE]
        > iOS 6.0 devices that are already enrolled will remain enrolled, but new devices must be running iOS version 7.1 or later in order to enroll in Intune.

    -   Google Android 4.0 and later (including Samsung KNOX)

    -   Windows Phone 8.0 and later

    -   Windows RT and Windows 8.1 RT

    -   Windows 8.1 and later computers (managed as mobile devices; see [Windows PC management capabilities in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Windows_PC_management_capabilities_in_Microsoft_Intune.md))

    -   Mac OS X 10.9 and later

    Before you can directly manage mobile devices you must [Set mobile device management authority and configure Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Set_mobile_device_management_authority_and_configure_Microsoft_Intune.md).

-   **Exchange ActiveSync**: To manage devices by using Exchange ActiveSync requires you to install the On-Premises Connector or use the built-in Service to Service Connector to connect to your Exchange Server.

    To learn about the hardware and software requirements to install the On-Premises Connector, see [Requirements for the On-Premises Connector](../Topic/Network_infrastructure_requirements_for_Microsoft_Intune.md#BKMK_ExchanceConnectorReqs).

    To learn about using the On-Premises Connector or Service to Service Connector with Exchange, see [Mobile device management with Exchange ActiveSync and Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Mobile_device_management_with_Exchange_ActiveSync_and_Microsoft_Intune.md).

## Mobile device management features
Intune supports mobile device management of iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices. It also supports management of Windows RT and Window computers as mobile devices. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] can manage users' devices, popularly known as "bring your own device" (BYOD). It can also manage company-owned devices including scenarios where the company provides a list of devices users may choose from, known as "choose your own device" (CYOD).

You can enroll devices to meet your organization's needs:

|Enrollment type|BYOD|CYOD|Shared device with manager account|Shared device without a user account|
|-------------------|--------|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|**Description**|Personal device enrolled using Microsoft Intune|Corporate-owned device for single user|Corporate-owned device managed using a manager account shared by many users|Corporate-owned user-less device used by many users.|
|**Device’s user**|Owner|Assigned user|No user-specific account|No specific user|
|**Who enrolls**|Owner|Administrator|Device Manager|Anyone|
|**Who un-enrolls**|Owner or administrator|Administrator|Administrator|Administrator|
|**Who can reset**|Owner or administrator|Administrator|Administrator|Administrator|
To enroll mobile devices you must set [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] as your *mobile device authority* and then configure the infrastructure to support the platforms you want to managed. This requires establishing a trust relationship with the device.

Management, inventory, app deployment, provisioning, and retirement are all handled through the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] administration console. Users gain access to the company portal which allows them to install apps, enroll and remove devices, and helps them contact their IT department or helpdesk.

**Mobile device management (MDM) capabilities** differ across mobile device platforms but all platforms support the following:

-   **Certificate, email, VPN and Wifi profiles.** You can deploy certificate profiles to mobile devices, and also deploy e-mail, VPN and Wifi profiles. See [Enable access to company resources with Microsoft Intune - deleted](../Topic/Enable_access_to_company_resources_with_Microsoft_Intune_-_deleted.md).

-   **Manage corporate-owned iOS devices.** You can set up devices for enrollment and then distribute them to specific users, or you can enroll devices so that they can be shared by multiple users. See [Set up iOS and Mac management with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Set_up_iOS_and_Mac_management_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

-   **Mobile application management.** Managed mobile apps can be configured to restrict certain app operations, such as copy and paste, to help protect your organization’s data. You can also use the managed browser to control the sites that users are allowed to visit. See [Configure and deploy mobile application management policies in the Microsoft Intune console](../Topic/Configure_and_deploy_mobile_application_management_policies_in_the_Microsoft_Intune_console.md) and [Manage Internet access using managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Manage_Internet_access_using_managed_browser_policies_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

-   **Conditional access.** Use [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] conditional access policies to control access to on-premises Microsoft Exchange email from mobile devices, even when the device is not managed by Intune. See [Manage access to email and SharePoint with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Manage_access_to_email_and_SharePoint_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

-   **Passwords management** differs across mobile device platforms, but all platforms let you require a password, limit the number of failed attempts, limit the minutes before the screen locks, set password expiration, and prevent previously-used passwords.

-   **Application settings.** You can control browser settings, and also such application settings as whether app stores can be used on mobile devices.

-   **Device capabilities, cellular and voice.** You can allow or deny the use of a camera, control roaming settings, and enable or disable iOS voice assistant and voice dialing features.

-   **Reset passcodes, lock, selectively wipe or retire devices.** You can reset passcodes if users lose access to their device, lock missing or stolen devices, or even wipe data off of missing or stolen devices.
