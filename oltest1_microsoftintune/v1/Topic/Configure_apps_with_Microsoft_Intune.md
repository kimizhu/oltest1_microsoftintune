# Configure apps with Microsoft Intune
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] gives you tools that help you manage, configure, and protect company data in your apps.

## Mobile app configuration policies
Use mobile app configuration policies to supply configuration settings to an app when it runs. For example, you can specify language, security, or network settings for the app. This removes the need for end users to configure the app, and reduces calls to your help desk.

For more information, see [Configure apps with mobile app configuration policies in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Configure_apps_with_mobile_app_configuration_policies_in_Microsoft_Intune.md).

## Mobile app management policies
Use [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] mobile app management policies to help protect company app data by restricting functionality that transfers data between apps. For example, you can restrict cut, copy and paste operations within a managed app.

For more information, see [Configure data loss prevention app policies with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Configure_data_loss_prevention_app_policies_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

## Managed browser policies
The managed browser is a web browsing application that you can deploy in your organization using [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]. A managed browser policy configures an allow list or a block list that restricts the web sites that users of the managed browser can visit.

Because this app is a managed app, you can also apply mobile application management policies to the app, such as controlling the use of cut, copy and paste, preventing screen captures, and also ensuring that links to content that users click only open in other managed apps.

For more information, see [Manage Internet access using managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Manage_Internet_access_using_managed_browser_policies_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).
