# Windows Team configuration policy settings in Microsoft Intune
Use the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] **Windows 10 Team general configuration policy** to configure settings for enrolled Windows 10 Team devices such as the Microsoft Surface Hub.

## Create a Windows 10 Team configuration policy

#### To provide basic settings for the configuration policy

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Click **Windows** &gt; **General Configuration (Windows 10 Team and later)** and then click **Create Policy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot create a configuration policy using recommended settings. You must create a custom policy.

3.  In the **General** section of the **Create Policy** page, specify a name and a description for the new policy.

4.  Use the information in the following section to help you supply settings for the policy.

5.  When you are finished, click **Save Policy**.

The new policy displays in the **Configuration Policies** node of the **Policy** workspace.
