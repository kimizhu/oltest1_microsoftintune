## General troubleshooting guidelines
Here are some general troubleshooting guidelines that can help you resolve issues in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].

Start by **defining the problem**:

-   What is the behavior?

-   Who experiences this behavior, and on what devices?

-   Did the device work properly previously?

-   What changes did you make to the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] or device configuration?

-   Consider whether other changes were made to the environment in which you operate, other than configuration changes.

-   How frequently does this problem occur, and is it sporadic or consistent?

After you've defined the problem, **collect available data**. This can include:

-   Device logs.

-   Admin console data, for example, for policy implementation issues you should examine the intended policy and the status of that policy, as described in [Use groups to manage users and devices with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Use_groups_to_manage_users_and_devices_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

After you've defined the problem and collected data you can **research the solution**:

-   Search the Web for a solution. For example, if you receive the error 0x80073CF0, you can search for **technet intune 0x80073cf0** on the Web, and find the article [Troubleshoot app deployment problems in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Troubleshoot_app_deployment_problems_in_Microsoft_Intune.md), which offers suggestions for addressing this issue.

-   You can search for an answer in the [Intune TechNet forum](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=microsoftintuneprod).  If the issue has not been previously addressed you should post the question to see what suggestions the community might have.

-   You can open a support request. Intune Support will be better able to help you resolve an issue when you've defined the problem and have collected the available data.
