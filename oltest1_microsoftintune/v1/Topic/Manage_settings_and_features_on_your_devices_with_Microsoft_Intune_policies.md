# Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] uses **policies** that help you to configure many security and functional settings for enrolled mobile devices, including:

-   Hardware settings, like allowing use of the devices camera, or Bluetooth capability

-   Password settings including password length and quality

-   Allowed and blocked apps let you configure apps that are compliant, or noncompliant in your organization, and then report on devices that are not compliant (for Windows Phone devices, you can block apps from being installed, or used.

-   Kiosk mode settings that allow you to ‘lock down’ certain features of the device like allowing only one app to run, or disabling the power button and volume controls.

Use the information in this topic to help you decide which policy you need to use to manage your devices.

> [!TIP]
> For more detailed information about how to use policies, see [Use policies to manage computers and mobile devices with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Use_policies_to_manage_computers_and_mobile_devices_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).
