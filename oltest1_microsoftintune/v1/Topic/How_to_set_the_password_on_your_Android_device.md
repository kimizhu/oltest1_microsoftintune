# How to set the password on your Android device
To reconnect to your work, youâ€™ll need to set the password on your device by following these instructions:

1.  In **Settings** on your device, click **Security** &gt; **Screen Lock** &gt; **Password**.

2.  Choose and then verify your new password. If you were informed that your device password is less than the required password length, ensure that you enter a password that is long enough.

3.  Ensure that your device is enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] by following the instructions in [Enroll your device to use it at work](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=519071).
