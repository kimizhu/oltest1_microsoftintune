# iOS configuration policy settings in Microsoft Intune
Use the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)]**iOS general configuration policy** to configure settings for:

-   **Mobile device security settings** – Choose from a list of predefined settings that let you control a range of features and functionality on the device.

-   **Kiosk mode** - Lock a device to only allow certain features to work. For example, you can allow a device to only run one managed app that you specify, or you can disable the volume buttons on a device. These settings might be used for a demonstration model of a device, or a device that is dedicated to performing only one function, such as a point of sale device.

-   **Compliant and noncompliant apps** - Specify a list of apps that are compliant, or not compliant in your company. On Android and iOS devices, the **Noncompliant Apps Report** can be used to view the compliance of apps you specified in the list against the apps that users have installed (but cannot actually block the installation of the app).

> [!TIP]
> You can configure terms and conditions for users to ensure that they acknowledge that apps on their device, including personal apps will be evaluated, and noncompliant apps will either be blocked, or reported as noncompliant. Users must accept these terms and conditions before they can enroll their device and use the company portal to get apps. For more information about using terms and conditions, see [Working with terms and conditions policies in Microsoft Intune](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ce59fb93-01fd-4822-a57d-45ca7d89843d).

## Create an iOS general configuration policy

#### To provide basic settings for the configuration policy

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Add Policy**.

2.  Click **iOS** &gt; **General Configuration** and then click **Create Policy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot create a configuration policy using recommended settings. You must create a custom policy.

3.  In the **General** section of the **Create Policy** page, specify a name and a description for the new policy.

4.  Use the information in the following sections to help you supply settings for the policy.

5.  When you are finished, click **Save Policy**.

The new policy displays in the **Configuration Policies** node of the **Policy** workspace.

## <a name="BKMK_Settings"></a>Settings for iOS devices
If the setting you are looking for does not appear in this list, you might be able to create it using an iOS custom policy that lets you import settings you created using the [Apple Configurator Tool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12). For more information, see [iOS custom policy settings in Microsoft Intune](../Topic/iOS_custom_policy_settings_in_Microsoft_Intune.md).

|**Required password type – Minimum number of character sets**<br /><br />There are four character sets, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This setting specifies how many different character sets must be included in the password).

> [!NOTE]
> The following notes apply to kiosk mode settings for iOS devices:
> 
> -   Before you can configure an iOS device for kiosk mode, you must use the [Apple Configurator Tool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12) or device enrollment manager to put the device into supervised mode. For more information about the Apple Configurator Tool, see your Apple documentation.
> -   If the iOS app you specify is installed after you deploy the configuration policy, the device will not enter kiosk mode until after it is restarted.

## Deploy the Configuration Policy

1.  Deploy the configuration policy to one or more groups of users or devices in your organization.

For more information about how to deploy policies, see [Use policies to manage computers and mobile devices with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Use_policies_to_manage_computers_and_mobile_devices_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

A status summary and alerts In the **Policy** workspace identify issues with the policy that require your attention. Additionally, a status summary appears in the **Dashboard** workspace.

## Reference information for compliant and noncompliant apps

### Monitor compliant and noncompliant apps
Use the **Noncompliant Apps Report** to view the compliance of allowed and blocked apps.

##### To run the Noncompliant Apps Report

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Reports** &gt; **Noncompliant Apps Report**.

2.  Select the device groups that you would like to check, whether you want to check for compliant apps, noncompliant apps, or both, then click **View Report**.

### <a name="BKMK_URL"></a>How to specify URLs to app stores
To specify an app URL in the compliant and noncompliant apps list, or in the **Select a managed app that will be allowed to run when the device is in kiosk mode** option (iOS only), use the following format:

Using a search engine, find the app you want to use in the iTunes App Store and open the page for the app.

Copy the URL of the page and use this as the URL to configure the compliant or noncompliant apps list or the app you want to run in kiosk mode.

**Example:** Search for **Microsoft Word for iPad**. The URL you use will be **https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-word-for-ipad/id586447913?mt=8**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the iTunes software to find the app and then use the **Copy Link** command to get the app URL.
