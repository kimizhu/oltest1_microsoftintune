# How to get support for Microsoft Intune
With every [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] subscription, Microsoft Support provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support. Support is available both online and by telephone for paid and trial subscriptions. Online technical support is available in English and Japanese. Non-technical support is available in additional languages.

## <a name="BKMK_Contact"></a>About support
This topic describes how to obtain support,  includes links that take you to the page where you can open a service request, and a link to a list of phone numbers for phone support in many languages.

For self help with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], see the [Documentation for Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Documentation_for_Microsoft_Intune.md) on TechNet, or click the Help link located at the top right-hand corner of the Intune administrative consoles.

### Online service requests

##### To create an online service request

1.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] and then visit the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/Support/SupportEntry.aspx).

2.  Under the heading **Create a service request** select the category of issue for which you want to open a ticket:

    -   For billing and licensing issues select **Billing and product info**.

    -   For all other [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] issues select **Mobile device management**. This option also covers Office 365 MDM and System Center Configuration Manager with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may have to click **more** at the bottom of the list to see all of the categories.

3.  On the **identify the issue** page select the **Feature** and **Symptom** for which you need help. You will be asked to provide an **Issue summary** and **Issue details**.

4.  On the **review suggestions** page you'll find links to content that may help you resolve the issue on your own.  If you can't resolve the issue you can click **Yes, continue** at the bottom of the page to submit your service request.

5.  On the **add details** page, provide the requested information. You can attach screenshots or other documents by clicking **attach a file**.

## Responding to support cases
We prioritize the support cases we receive so that we can take care of the most urgent cases most quickly. To help us prioritize support cases we give each case a severity level shown in the following table. You can also see response times for each severity level.

**Initial Response Times:**

|Severity Level|Operations and Support Description|[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] / Enterprise Mobility Suite<br /><br />Premier|[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] / Enterprise Mobility Suite<br /><br />Professional|
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Sev A(Critical)|One or more services aren’t accessible or are unusable. Production, operations, or deployment deadlines are severely affected, or there will be a severe impact on production or profitability. Multiple users or services are affected.|1 Hour|2 Hours|
|Sev B(High)|The service is usable but in an impaired fashion. The situation has moderate business impact and can be dealt with during business hours. A single user, customer, or service is partially affected.|2 Hours|4 Hours|
|Sev C(Medium)|The situation has minimal business impact. The issue is important but does not have a significant current service or productivity impact for the customer. A single user is experiencing partial disruption, but an acceptable workaround exists.|4 Hours|8 Hours|

## <a name="BKMK_SupportResponsibilities"></a>Support partnership
Successful technical support depends on the partnership between Microsoft support and your organization's IT department.  Initial troubleshooting efforts in your organization, combined with effective communication between your admins and Microsoft, can help resolve issues quickly.

### How your administrators can help
People with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] administrator roles (including tenant administrators and service administrators) are authorized to access the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] Administration console and to communicate directly with Microsoft about [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] service requests. These administrators can also include Microsoft partners that you have specified as [delegated administrators](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646948.aspx#BKMK_ManagePartners).

The administrator:

-   Manages service administration and account maintenance

-   Submits service requests to Microsoft

-   Provides user account setup and configuration to allow users access to the services

-   Manages client connectivity and software installation issues

-   Manages service availability issues within your organization

-   Uses Microsoft’s self-service support resources to resolve support issues

Microsoft Support is here to assist you should your issue persist in spite of your troubleshooting efforts.

### How Microsoft Support can help
Our role is to:

-   Troubleshoot, manage, and resolve customer issues and escalations

-   Gather and validate information related to specific service requests

-   Provide issue coordination and resolution management

-   Maintain communication with your administrators to help ensure that issues are addressed on an ongoing basis

-   Provide assistance with licensing, invoicing, and subscription inquiries

-   Provide assistance with purchasing and trial inquiries

-   Continually gather customer feedback on how to improve the service through surveys
